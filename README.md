 Transmission lines are used to transfer electrical energy from one point to 
another, typically over long distances. These lines are made up of conductors that are supported 
by towers or poles, and they are designed to minimize energy losses due to resistance and other 
factors. Transmission lines can carry AC or DC currents and are typically used to connect power 
plants to substations or to distribute electricity to industrial, commercial, and residential 
customers.
